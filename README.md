## About me

It is my pleasure to meet you here. I am **Zhang Zhaoji(张兆骥 in Chinese)**, an undergraduate at Peking University majoring in Chemical Biology with a double major in Artificial Intelligence. My curiosity about Neuroscience, especially circuit and system neuroscience, has led me to be an intern at Yatang-Li's Lab at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing (CIBR, Beijing).

[My academic transcript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxR2OdMEvwfcwAbwhDBF-TSwfSUIFzzJ/view?usp=sharing) is available for a deeper look into my academic journey, and you can find my research profile on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-3293-1961).

For regular communication, please use my student email: **zhang-zj@stu.pku.edu.cn** （because check my student email is one of my daily routine）. In case you want to contact me when our server being shutdown(rare but not totally possible), Here is my personal e-mail address which is zhang_zhaoji@foxmail.com (usually I would check it once per week or month).

## coding languages

Most of coding works I have done is about computer vision or Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning, thus Python is my first-choice coding language. Pytorch is the most common DL-framework I use, but I would learn tensorflow if necessary.

| Rank |   Language    |  Familiarity   |
|-----:|---------------|--------------|
|     1|   **Python**  |  proficient  |
|     2|   R           |  proficient  |
|     3|   matlab      |  Competent   |
|     3|   c++         |  Competent   |
