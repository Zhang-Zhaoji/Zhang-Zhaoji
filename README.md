## About Me

It is my pleasure to meet you here. I am **Zhang Zhaoji(张兆骥 in Chinese)**, a graduate From Peking University majoring in Chemical Biology with a double major in Artificial Intelligence. I will go to Center for Life Sciences (CLS) at Peking University and Tsinghua University to pursue a doctorate.

My curiosity about Neuroscience, especially circuit and system neuroscience, has led me to be an intern at [Yatang-Li's Lab](https://yatanglilab.cibr.ac.cn/en/) at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing (CIBR, Beijing). 

[My academic transcript](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ah_4_Sy2JGNygSQ7jt_fCIdXzE2-?e=GE2ChP) is available for a deeper look into my academic journey, and you can find my research profile on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-3293-1961).

For regular communication, please contact me through my student email: **zhang-zj@alumni.pku.edu.cn** (Checking my student email is one of my daily routine). In case you want to contact me when our server being shutdown(may happen 1~10 times per year), Here is my personal e-mail address: zhang_zhaoji@foxmail.com (usually I would check it once per week or month, but not ensured).

## Coding Languages

Most of the coding works I have done is about computer vision or Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning, thus Python is my first-choice coding language. C/C++ is used for replace some for/while loops to get higher speed, although the easiest way to use .dll files in python, ctype, only permits basic C-style data structures. 

I would use R to do some data analysis or statistic jobs, and R-codes are really good(and also easy) at drawing beautiful scientific figures. R-markdown is just like Python notebook, but R seems to have relatively faster speed.

Pytorch is the most common DL-framework I use, but I would learn tensorflow if necessary.
